This massive inter-network, the progenitor of today&#x27;s Internet, set the stage for what would become the largest machine in existence. This article focuses less on this marvel of engineering and more on a vision encapsulated by Vin Cerf, one of the scientists who worked on ARPANET and the creator of TCP/IP:</p><p>&quot;The power of the Internet is its universality, accessible by anyone from anywhere, and its strength lies in its distributed nature <strong>without central control</strong>.&quot;</p><p>However, does today’s Internet and the delivery of bandwidth reflect this vision? Or do we see a landscape dominated by giants like Comcast, Verizon, Amazon and Google? Over the past 50 years, as the Internet has become ubiquitous, it has also seen unprecedented levels of hyper-consolidation, with more of its infrastructure controlled by fewer entities than ever before.</p><p>This centralization has strayed far from the Internet&#x27;s foundational ethos of universality and open access, overshadowed by commercial gains. While I could go on and on with quotes from Tim Berners-Lee, Bob Kahn, or David Clark to further illustrate how we’ve deviated from the intended decentralized nature of the Internet, this article seeks not to dwell on the past, but to chart a path forward.</p><p>Imagine a shift from a centralized to a decentralized Internet infrastructure—transforming who controls both connectivity and cloud infrastructure. What if this shift was not only feasible but also immediately profitable? Each incremental change could save money and generate profit since it doesn’t require enormous infrastructure investments. This article aims to make that case, centering on a pivotal development: <strong>multi-gigabit wireless technology.</strong></p><p>Wireless radios allow us to beam Internet through the air, at a fraction of the cost of alternatives like fiber. And for the first time in history (2024), wireless matches fiber in terms of performance at the last-mile and exceeds it in scalability, positioning it as a viable foundation for a new Internet. The question now is not about the technical feasibility, but the how—the systems, business models, and user experiences that will drive the widespread adoption of this technology to reclaim our Internet.</p><p>Central to this endeavor is the DAWN protocol—Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Networks. Developed by our team at Andrena and already serving 10,000 households across 10 states with this technology, DAWN uses blockchain to create a user-powered network of multi-gigabit wireless transmitters. </p><p>This protocol allows users to not only access affordable high-speed Internet but also become active nodes in a community-powered network, selling excess bandwidth and fostering a robust, decentralized network. Integrating advanced technologies like robotic antennas, cost-effective meshing Wi-Fi, and agile cloud-native routing, DAWN is not just about faster Internet—it’s about a sustainable, profitable model for users.</p><p>The protocol is a peek into a future where your Internet does more than connect you to the world—it connects the world back to you, turning every household into a pivotal node in the vast digital landscape we call the Internet. </p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>DAWN’s goals</strong></h4><p>Before we delve into the specifics of the protocol, hardware, and economics that drive DAWN, it’s imperative to clearly express its underlying vision. DAWN isn’t just a protocol for wireless; it&#x27;s a revolutionary overhaul of how the Internet and the cloud can be structured and delivered. At its core, DAWN aims to achieve two high-level objectives in one move:</p><ol role="list"><li>To turn internet bandwidth into a commodity – transforming bandwidth from a service provided solely by large corporations into a commodity that anyone can produce and sell, with a myriad of options to choose from on a last mile Internet marketplace / Internet exchange.”</li><li>To drive equity from centralized infrastructure entities directly into the home – instead of massive central data centers and network hubs monopolizing the Internet’s backbone, DAWN proposes moving the power directly into users&#x27; homes. This strategy turns every participating household into a mini data center, not only serving their Internet needs but also becoming an integral part of the global internet infrastructure. In a nutshell: we are moving away from a very few giant data centers to many thousands of small ones (households) thereby distributing and moving the wealth of cloud infrastructure into homes.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p><strong>Turning Bandwidth into a Tradable Commodity</strong></p><p>Traditionally, internet bandwidth has been a resource managed and distributed by large Internet Service Providers (ISPs), with consumers having no say over its allocation or pricing. DAWN disrupts this model by turning bandwidth into a commodity that every user can manage, use, and/or sell.</p><p>Utilizing the latest in Point-to-MultiPoint (PtMP) wireless technology, DAWN enables nodes to communicate directly with multiple nodes efficiently and at multi-gigabit speeds comparable to fiber. This capability is crucial because it allows for a high-density distribution of bandwidth among numerous users within a network, turning each node into a mini-ISP.</p><p>Users can purchase bandwidth in line with their actual usage and sell surplus bandwidth effortlessly. This system not only maximizes the efficiency of internet resource utilization but also opens up new financial opportunities for users. For example, during periods of low usage, a household could sell all or part of their bandwidth allocation to others, effectively turning their DAWN node into a source of passive income.</p><p>Think about how easy it is to share your Wi-Fi with your neighbor. Now imagine if you could do that effortlessly and were even encouraged to do so. Not only would it be possible to offset your Internet bill but users could be rewarded to do so.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Driving Value from Centralized Infrastructure Entities Directly into the Home</strong></p><p>The digital infrastructure sector, which includes both cloud computing and telecommunications, represents a massive market valued at approximately $2.2 trillion and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27%. Traditionally, this immense industry has been concentrated within a few large corporations. If this value could be redistributed (even only a small percentage) to individual households, the economic impact would be astronomical. </p><p>DAWN gives us an opportunity to profitably begin that transfer of value. Not only will DAWN nodes provide the cheapest Internet access, but they’ll also be bundled with a high-performance x86 router. Thanks to technologies like VPP and DPDK, a generic purpose x86 machine can also function as a router. This setup turns your home into a mini-datacenter, capable of serving applications to any Internet user.</p><p>This shift not only allows homeowners the opportunity to profit on excess bandwidth and generate income by offering digital services such as cloud storage, cloud computing, and AI training, directly from their homes.</p><p>Imagine if every Verizon or Comcast home router was replaced with a high-performance server that you owned - your home would power the Internet.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p>As we explore the technical and economic mechanisms of DAWN in the following sections, keep in mind these overarching goals. The technology isn’t just about faster and cheaper Internet — it’s about redefining the economic model of both cloud and telecom, making it more equitable, accessible, and controlled by those it serves. With your home as both a mini-ISP and mini-datacenter, you are the Internet.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>What is DAWN?</strong></h4><p>DAWN is a decentralized protocol designed to bootstrap and orchestrate multi-gigabit, user-powered mesh networks. This approach allows anyone to contribute wireless coverage and bandwidth to a city-wide network, democratizing Internet access in a manner similar to how solar panels democratize energy production – just as individuals can buy solar panels to reduce energy bills and sell excess energy back to the grid, DAWN enables users to buy their own Internet bandwidth and sell surplus back to a communal network. In essence, what solar panels have done for the third utility—electricity—DAWN aims to do for the fourth utility, the Internet.</p><p>Unlike solar panels, which can operate in isolation, mesh networking requires <strong>collaborative</strong> effort across multiple nodes to cover extensive areas. In order to ensure robust operation, the protocol is built on a foundation of <strong>trustless collaboration</strong>, which is absolutely crucial for the reliability and integrity of community-powered Internet infrastructure.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Blockchain Integration</strong></p><p>The use of blockchain enables DAWN to operate in a trustless environment. DAWN incorporates blockchain technology, employing three key mechanisms that collectively ensure a robust and transparent network:</p><ul role="list"><li>Proof of Backhaul – an empirical measure of the throughput capacity at each node.</li><li>Proof of Location – guarantees each node’s physical location is actually reported.</li><li>Proof of Frequency – confirms the wireless spectrum each node utilizes.</li></ul><p>These three mechanisms provide an almost complete representation of the wireless network, without relying on trust.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Proof of Backhaul (PoB)</strong></p><p>This mechanism is critical for maintaining transparency in service delivery. It provides a verifiable measure of the actual throughput at each node. For example if a node claims to provide 1Gbps but fails to do so and only delivers 400Mbps, PoB will be used to adjust the payment and delivery mechanisms and reimburse users for the lower performances, based on automatic/smart-contract Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This ensures users receive the service they pay for and the provider is paid what she is owed while entirely removing the need for trust. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Proof of Location (PoL)</strong></p><p>In any telecommunications network, identifying the specific location of a resource is critical for understanding where assets are able to provide service, which is vital for network planning and reliability. In a community powered mesh network, this is even more important. PoL holds nodes accountable for accurately reporting their stated location by tying network rewards to locations that are verifiable by other trusted nodes.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Proof of Frequency (PoF)</strong></p><p>Given the limited nature of wireless spectrum, effective management is essential to prevent pollution and interference. When nodes use whatever frequency they want, the wireless channels have an increased noise floor which provides worse wireless performance. PoF ensures that each node uses the appropriate frequency channels, particularly important in the 60GHz and 6GHz bands DAWN utilizes, to maintain high-quality network performance and avoid the congestion issues common in traditional 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi networks that don’t utilize any coordination mechanism.</p><p>‍</p><p>These proofs, which are implemented via smart contracts, allows DAWN to operate as a coordination layer, enabling the network to expand securely and efficiently. This layer promotes organic growth while ensuring that network standards for reliability and transparency are met, all in a trustless environment.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>The Hardware</strong></h4><p>To better understand how the DAWN protocol operates, it&#x27;s essential to examine the hardware components involved. The setup includes two key pieces:</p><ul role="list"><li>Robotic Antenna System (RAS) – This 30-inch dome houses a mechatronic system capable of real-time directional adjustments for optimal signal reception and self-healing capabilities. It enables precise aiming, which is crucial for establishing a robust connection. In addition, the RAS allows for auto-rederectioning towards a new node in case of lost connection should the original source connection fail. </li><li>Cloud Native Home Router – A compact, server-grade x86 computer that not only routes home Internet traffic but also connects to and supports the DAWN decentralized network. It is equipped with WiFi for meshing and capable of running any cloud application.</li></ul><p>Inspired by the simplicity of setups like Starlink, DAWN aims to offer an equally straightforward user experience. Let’s take a closer look at the components.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Robotic Antenna System (RAS):</strong></p><p>The RAS plays a critical role in achieving extensive network coverage. Since DAWN is based on point-to-multipoint (PtMP) broadcasting nodes, having a highly directional receiving node helps to pick up fainter signals at longer distances, but that requires precise aiming of that directional antenna. Automated aiming allows the antenna to point in any direction – 360 degrees around and 45 degrees up and down – with a technique called mechanical beam steering. While electrical beam steering with phased arrays would be ideal, current technological limitations necessitate the use of a more affordable mechatronic system.</p><p>Key benefits of the RAS include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Simplified user experience: RAS automates wireless provisioning and radio alignment, the two most challenging aspects of network setup, requiring no technical expertise from the user. This makes DAWN highly resilient to any issues with faulty connections.</li><li>Self-healing capabilities: The ability to dynamically re-point the antenna allows the network to reconfigure itself to find optimal paths for data transmission, enhancing reliability.</li><li>Vendor interoperability: By remaining radio agnostic, DAWN can utilize various radio platforms from different manufacturers to leverage the specific niches that each solution solves. </li></ul><p>The A in DAWN stands for Autonomous, and the RAS is the component that achieves that. If a distribution node goes down, or a better alternative or path appears, the RAS can realign and provision to establish a new connection. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Cloud Native Home Router:</strong></p><p>Unlike standard ISP-provided routers, which are generally limited in functionality and processing power, DAWN’s router is a high-performance x86 system. This router not only manages home Internet traffic but also acts as a node in the decentralized network. By operating on an x86 architecture, portability isn’t a concern, and almost any software can be run on it, including protocols such as Filecoin, Akash, and Render. This turns your router into a versatile server, making your home an active participant in the cloud.</p><p>Technical breakthroughs that enable this router include:</p><ul role="list"><li>DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit): Managed by the Linux Foundation, DPDK enhances network performance by allowing direct processor access to the NIC, facilitating efficient packet processing by user-space applications.</li><li>VPP (Vector Packet Processing): Developed by Cisco, VPP utilizes DPDK to batch and process packets collectively, significantly boosting router performance.</li></ul><p>These two components allow routing to occur on cheap hardware at &gt;1Gbps performance, which is critical for any high-capacity urban network. Additionally, the router leverages OpenWiFi and a unique Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD) based meshing solution to achieve the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>Simplified operation of residential and business WiFi systems with enterprise network segmentation and security.</li><li>Seamless gigabit-speed Internet sharing with neighbors without the need for rooftop antennas.</li></ul><p>Together, the Robotic Antenna System and the Cloud Native Home Router form the core hardware components of DAWN. These systems are designed to enhance and automate network coverage and stability while drastically simplifying the user experience. They also provide a robust platform for future cloud applications.</p><p>As DAWN continues to evolve, these hardware innovations are crucial for the practical implementation of a decentralized network. This network aims not only to deliver more affordable broadband to homes but also to transform the cloud into a user-powered ecosystem.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>The Economics</strong></h4><p>DAWN isn&#x27;t just about the technology to automatically connect; it&#x27;s underpinned by a cost-driven value network. This economic model emerges from a straightforward market analysis of global Internet prices, highlighting a significant disparity: Internet connectivity at data centers is relatively cheap, whereas last-mile connectivity to homes and businesses is notably expensive.</p><p>When compared to wireless internet connections, the disparity in prices can be explained by the extremely high costs of building and laying outdoor cables or fiber networks (aside from being impossible to operate under a decentralized model). To justify these investments, traditional ISPs have to charge high prices to yield reasonable financial returns.</p><p>To understand the economic model that is the catalyst for DAWN, there are two primary costs to consider: the cost of the infrastructure, and the cost of bandwidth.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Cost</strong></p><p>There are two important metrics that capture the cost of building any telecommunications networks:</p><ul role="list"><li>Cost to pass a home – The expense of extending network coverage, measured in dollars per household. This reflects the cost of laying fiber down a street or deploying a cell tower.</li><li>Cost to activate a home – Once the network reaches the vicinity of the home, this is the cost to make the actual connection and start service.</li></ul><p>While activating a home with decentralized fixed wireless (~$1,000) is more expensive than with fiber ($2-400), the cost to pass a home is substantially lower ($10-15 for fixed wireless, $750-$1,100 for fiber). This higher efficiency in coverage creation makes DAWN feasible, enabling widespread and cost-effective wireless coverage. Though activation is pricier, it includes benefits like ownership, potential for passive income, and access to cheaper bandwidth.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Bandwidth Cost</strong></p><p>To fully understand the economic advantage of DAWN, it&#x27;s essential to delve into the specifics of how bandwidth is sourced and priced at the wholesale level. This involves exploring two critical components: wholesale IP transit and Internet Exchanges, which are central to achieving cost-effective Internet access.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Wholesale IP transit</strong></p><p>Wholesale IP Transit refers to the service where ISPs, content delivery networks (CDNs), and large enterprises purchase bulk internet connectivity from tier-1 networks capable of routing data globally. These wholesale providers have extensive network infrastructures that connect multiple regions and continents, ensuring data can flow across the internet efficiently and at high speeds. </p><p>Purchasing from these providers offers excellent economies of scale, with prices dropping 20-30% YoY due to a very competitive landscape. The rapid advancement of fiber technology, namely the ability to pack multiple wavelengths of light on a single dark fiber strand, has allowed these providers to pass a staggering amount of traffic all around the globe.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Internet Exchanges</strong></p><p>Internet Exchanges (IXs) are key physical infrastructure within the internet ecosystem where different networks—such as ISPs, CDNs, and large enterprises—meet to exchange traffic directly between their networks. This direct interchange is known as peering.</p><p>IXs create a virtual connectivity fabric in a given region to facilitate the direct flow of Internet traffic between service providers and content, and represent the Internet at its best – distributed and open. Because the scope of their connectivity is limited (within a region), and thanks to the consolidation of cloud providers (most traffic goes to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc., which are all at IXs), this direct peering allows for significant reductions in cost and latency.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Implications</strong></p><p>By combining these two sources of traffic together, bandwidth becomes remarkably inexpensive. At small volumes,<strong> a residential gigabit service can cost as little as $0.45</strong>, with a dedicated gigabit connection costing $40.</p><p>Internet bills are predominantly driven by the infrastructure cost, <strong>not</strong> the cost of bandwidth itself. </p><p>Both of these sources of bandwidth are the direct result of the immense demand for Internet service and the experiences we enjoy on them. And now, we can use them, paired with wireless, to provide wholesale connectivity <em>everywhere</em>. Step 1 will see DAWN turn the last mile into a mesh network, and step 2 will <strong>turn the last mile into an Internet Exchange</strong> to allow for the trading of bandwidth. Allowing IXs to be directly accessible to the last mile is how bandwidth turns into a commodity.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What this means</strong></p><p>Here’s what these two cost items mean for DAWN:</p><ul role="list"><li>Internet bandwidth is incredibly cheap, at the right locations.</li><li>Fixed wireless provides the most cost-effective means of creating coverage.</li><li>The primary expense is in the initial activation of a home.</li></ul><p>DAWN&#x27;s economic model allows users to cover the start-up cost, own part of the infrastructure in an open system, and access significantly lower bandwidth rates, historically available only at data centers. If a node operator sells a residential gigabit internet connection for $10, they can achieve <strong>profit margins in excess of 90%</strong>. This setup not only offers a payback period of less than a year but also offers the potential to resell excess capacity.</p><p>This approach exemplifies the promise of wireless technology: to provide cheaper internet, without wires, across broader areas, all with a rapid return on investment.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Technological Significance</strong></h4><p>This final section explores the crucial role DAWN plays in addressing real, emerging challenges faced by digital infrastructure systems. Below, we present three practical examples of how DAWN responds to the pressing needs of today&#x27;s Internet networks.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Filling a gap in the OSI Model</strong></p><p><strong><em>OSI Primer</em></strong></p><p>The OSI model organizes network architecture into layers, each responsible for different aspects of data communication between computers across a network. Here&#x27;s a brief overview of the relevant layers: </p><ul role="list"><li>Layer 1, Physical Layer: This layer handles the physical transmission of data across media, such as pulses of light over fiber or frequency modulation in wireless communications. Protocols at this layer define how network packets are physically modulated to transmit data.</li><li>Layer 2, Link Layer: Responsible for transmitting network frames over the physical layer between nodes within the same network, with Ethernet and WiFi being prominent examples.</li><li>Layer 3, Network Layer: Facilitates the transmission of network packets (within a frame) between different networks. The Internet Protocol (IP), which routes data from local networks to global destinations, operates at this layer.</li><li>Layer 4, Transport Layer (TCP/UDP): While IP moves packets, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) establish connections between computers, providing an interface for applications to send data back and forth.</li></ul><p>These layers illustrate the intricate &quot;layered onion&quot; required to send data between computers. </p><p>It’s important to remember that the protocols at each layer evolve over time as Internet usage changes and technological advancements emerge. For instance:</p><ul role="list"><li>ARPANET originally utilized NCP, and then Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn invented TCP/IP as a better alternative.</li><li>WiFi was developed as a way to leverage advancements in wireless frequency modulation.</li><li>IPv6 was introduced in response to the depletion of IPv4 addresses.</li><li>QUIC was designed to address the shortcomings of UDP while leveraging its performance benefits.</li></ul><p>The OSI model adapts based on business needs, performance requirements, and underlying technologies that enhance the capabilities of the layers above.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>DAWN&#x27;s Role in Evolving the OSI Model</strong></p><p>The advent of multi-gigabit mesh networking comes with new challenges that necessitates the development of a specialized protocol to enhance the OSI model. DAWN operates primarily as a Layer 1 protocol, providing a coordination layer specifically for wireless physical resources. Unlike TCP/IP, which serves as a universal standard for packet delivery and network coordination across Layer 3/4, the physical layer currently lacks a global standard for constructing and managing network infrastructure.</p><p>While WiFi and Ethernet offer solutions for individual links in a network, they do not provide a unified protocol for coordinating resources across an entire network. Developing a decentralized global standard at the physical layer, akin to the role of IP at the network layer, will fundamentally transform how networks are built and operated, enabling more cohesive and scalable network architectures. DAWN aims to fill this gap, ushering in a new era of network infrastructure development that aligns with the evolving demands of modern internet usage.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Democratizing Open Access Networks (OAN)</strong></p><p><strong><em>OAN Primer</em></strong></p><p>An Open Access Network (OAN) is a network infrastructure model designed to separate the physical access to the network from the services provided over the network. This model enables multiple service providers to offer Internet service over a single physical network infrastructure, which is typically owned and maintained by a separate entity. This approach promotes competition among service providers, potentially lowering costs and improving service quality for end-users.</p><p>Key features of Open Access Networks include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Infrastructure Neutrality: The network owner does not provide any services on the network other than infrastructure access. This neutrality allows service providers to compete on an equal footing, fostering a competitive marketplace for network services.</li><li>Multiple Service Providers: Consumers can choose from various service providers who offer their services over the common infrastructure. This choice empowers consumers to select services that best meet their needs and budgets.</li><li>Enhanced Competition: Since the infrastructure allows any qualified provider to offer services, there tends to be more competitive pricing, better service quality, and innovative product offerings.</li><li>Economies of Scale: The shared use of infrastructure reduces redundant investments in network construction, achieving economies of scale and more efficient use of resources.</li></ul><p>Often considered the gold standard in municipal networks for their open nature, Open Access Networks aim to take the dynamics of an Internet Exchange and bring them to the last mile. </p><p>While OANs provide an excellent solution to many of the problems discussed in this article, they come with a few key implementation challenges that will need to be overcome in the early stages to achieve large-scale widespread adoption:</p><ul role="list"><li>Regulatory hurdles: Establishing an OAN often requires navigating complex regulatory environments that may not be initially set up to support this model. Not all states are allowed to have OANs.</li><li>Requires trust among stakeholders: Effective coordination among the infrastructure owner, service providers, and regulators is crucial and is complex to manage, while simultaneously requiring trust. </li><li>Expensive Infrastructure: Significant upfront capital is needed to build and maintain the network infrastructure, as these are typically built over fiber or existing coaxial networks. </li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>DAWN’s Role in Overcoming OAN Implementation Challenges</strong></p><p>DAWN inherently provides solutions that directly tackle the primary challenges associated with deploying open access networks:</p><ul role="list"><li>Eliminating Regulatory Hurdles: DAWN&#x27;s decentralized, blockchain-based architecture offers a transparent and auditable system that shifts power from a centralized entity to a network powered by individuals. This approach reduces regulatory complexities and enhances compliance transparency.</li><li>Removing the Necessity for Trust: Through the implementation of Proof of Backhaul, Location, and Frequency, DAWN establishes a trustless environment. These proofs allow various stakeholders to cooperate seamlessly, ensuring reliability and integrity without the traditional need for trust.</li><li>Cost-Effective Coverage: As discussed in the fiber cost analysis, wireless technology presents a viable and cost-effective alternative for network coverage. DAWN leverages this advantage, pioneering the standardization of Open Access Networks over wireless, which has yet to see widespread adoption.</li></ul><p>With its core principles aligned with the ethos of open access networks—from creating an Internet marketplace to promoting shared infrastructure and maintaining neutrality—DAWN acts as a foundational protocol for building <strong>decentralized Open Access Networks (dOAN)</strong>. This alignment ensures that DAWN is not only a technical solution but also a transformative force in the democratization of network access.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>DAWN provides a home for low-cost AI training</strong></p><p>With the underlying vision of bringing the cloud into people’s homes, DAWN’s nodes will be capable of facilitating the large-scale need for AI training hardware. The various networks in DAWN will facilitate this with the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>Decentralized Training Nodes: With a network of home-based x86 routers with PCIe expansion, nodes will be able to host cost-effective GPUs with tensor cores. These devices, part of the DAWN ecosystem, form a decentralized grid of AI training nodes.</li><li>Verifiable Performance Metrics: With DAWN’s proofs of network quality, each node’s throughput and performance metrics are verifiably recorded. This transparency ensures that AI training tasks are allocated efficiently based on the real-time capabilities of the network.</li><li>Cost-Effective Infrastructure: These AI training nodes are markedly cheaper than setting up TPUs in data centers. Homeowners will install these x86 routers to not only access affordable high-speed Internet but also participate in the AI training network. This model not only reduces the footprint of training operations but also leverages existing residential spaces, which are orders of magnitude less costly than data center footprints.</li></ul><p>Through reducing Internet prices, DAWN provides a business accelerator to get more reliable tensor cores into people’s homes. This setup creates a symbiotic relationship where AI training demands drive the deployment of affordable, home networking equipment, simultaneously solving the cost problem of AI training and improving Internet access.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Some Further Ideas: a Home for AI Training</strong></h4><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen exponential growth, with applications across various sectors. Key to this growth are two primary types of GPU-intensive activities: <strong>training AI models and serving AI applications</strong>. Training involves teaching models using large datasets, which requires significant computational power and time, while serving refers to the deployment of these models to perform tasks in real-time, demanding high-speed and efficient processing capabilities.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>The Challenge with AI Training</strong></p><p>Training AI models is computationally intensive and traditionally done in data centers equipped with high-performance GPUs. However, this approach is becoming increasingly expensive due to the high costs associated with scaling and hosting such hardware at data centers. As AI technologies continue to advance, the need for affordable and scalable solutions for training becomes critical. According to industry estimates, the AI market is projected to grow 28% annually in the coming years, but the associated costs for training in data centers are not sustainable for widespread AI adoption.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h4><p>As I write this article, I find myself incredibly excited about the rapid pace of technology. Whether it’s AI, wireless, or a fundamental shift in cloud infrastructure, it feels like we’re standing on the cusp of a generational leap in Internet technology.</p><p>This next leap comes with its challenges, of course. The explosion of data, the increasing complexity of network orchestration, and the heightened expectations for faster, cheaper, and more reliable access are just the beginning. Additionally, there&#x27;s the pressing issue of the digital divide, where access to the latest technological advancements remains unevenly distributed across different socioeconomic and geographical groups.</p><p>Addressing these challenges demands not just incremental improvements, but radical innovations that can fundamentally reshape our digital infrastructure. This is where DAWN steps in, offering a robust framework for leveraging decentralized technologies to democratize access to high-speed internet and transform individual homes into powerhouses of the Internet ecosystem.</p><p>I hope this article casts some light on what we believe is the path forward for a new digital landscape. We are presented with an opportunity to significantly improve the system that connects us all. DAWN is designed to ensure that the future of the Internet is more inclusive, more efficient, and more equitable for everyone.</p><p>As I mentioned at the start of this piece, envision a future where your Internet does more than just connect you to the world—it connects the world back to you.</p><p>‍</p><p>- Neil C</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="section_footer"><div class="padding-global"><div class="container"><div data-w-id="9e61d0c8-cc7f-479b-1d70-ee757c7cff58" class="footer-content w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-4"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/6679a4d9118fa2bac876799b_logo-new-orange-blck.webp" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 150px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/6679a4d9118fa2bac876799b_logo-new-orange-blck-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/6679a4d9118fa2bac876799b_logo-new-orange-blck-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/6679a4d9118fa2bac876799b_logo-new-orange-blck.webp 1315w" alt="" class="logo"/><div class="foot">© 2024</div><div class="foot">All rights reserved.</div><div class="foot"><a href="http://dawninternet.com/privacy" class="link">Privacy Policy</a><link rel="prefetch" href="http://dawninternet.com/privacy"/> and <a href="http://dawninternet.com/terms" target="_blank" class="link">Terms &amp; Conditions</a><link rel="prerender" href="http://dawninternet.com/terms"/></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-4"><a href="../index.html" class="link is-footer">Home</a><a href="../index.html#how" class="link is-footer">How DAWN works</a><link rel="prefetch" href="../index.html#how"/><a href="../validator-extension.html" class="link is-footer">Validator extension</a><link rel="prefetch" href="../validator-extension.html"/><a href="../research.html" class="link is-footer">Research</a><link rel="prefetch" href="../research.html"/><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/66c3c22442580dcd5962c723_DAWN%20Whitepaper%20July%2025%2C%202024%20(1).pdf" target="_blank" class="link is-footer">Whitepaper</a><link rel="prefetch" href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/66c3c22442580dcd5962c723_DAWN%20Whitepaper%20July%2025%2C%202024%20(1).pdf"/></div><div class="w-col w-col-4"><div><a href="https://x.com/dawninternet" target="_blank" class="link is-footer">Follow on X</a><link rel="prefetch" href="https://x.com/dawninternet"/></div><a href="https://discord.gg/pb9ktNCKvr" target="_blank" class="link is-footer">Discord</a><link rel="prefetch" href="https://discord.gg/pb9ktNCKvr"/><a href="https://t.me/+KbNPWHXb2n5iNTIx" target="_blank" class="link is-footer">Telegram</a><link rel="prefetch" href="https://t.me/+KbNPWHXb2n5iNTIx"/></div></div></div></div></footer></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665dc8eb8d9f8c4764608070/js/webflow.07bc8d717.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
